The first trend I noticed was that there a larger number of males who play the game than any other gender. 

Second, players that are between the age of 20-24 were most likely to participate 
in the game because they have the highest purchase count of items when compared to other age demographics.

Lastly, Non-Disclosed genders made up the smallest portion of players and are least active in the game.

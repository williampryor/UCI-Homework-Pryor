For the capomulin scatter plot it is evident that as the weight of the mouse increased the average tumor volume tended to increase. 

The results of capomulin in the line chart also show that when mice were treated with capomulin their tumor volume decreased over time. 
Overall the tumor volume line tends to decrease more on average than increase and shows us a large rate decrease in tumor volume after the 
8th timepoint tick.
This shows that capomulin is successful in treating tumors in mice.

With our boxplot we can see that the medians for Infubinol and Ceftamin are almost identical when it comes to tumor volume. This gives us a 
more useful dataset to read into when compared to capomulin and ramicane.
